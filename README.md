**Accident Clustering approach for Accident Prediction (ACAP)**  
ACAP compares accident prediction on different spatial aggregations. 

The repository contains two folders: 
1. Data preprocessing pipeline  
   The data preprocessing pipeline mainly process accident data from "Unfallatlas" and OpenStreetMap. It also implements various clustering pipeline,e.g., Grid        Growing, DBSCAN, Kmeans, SOM, and HDBSCAN 
2. Model Implementations  
   This folder consists of our model(ACAP) as well implementation of different baselines.
  
 **Tools:-**  
   * Python(3.7)
   * Keras(2.3.1)
   * tensorflow(2.2.0)
   * scikit-learn(0.24.1)  

All the experiment are performed on GPU.
